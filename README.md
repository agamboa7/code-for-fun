# code-for-fun
A personal collection of small scripts and tools Iâ€™ve written for fun, curiosity, or to solve specific problems.

Each folder in this repository contains:
- A standalone Python script
- A README.md explaining what it does
- (Sometimes) sample input/output files or instructions for usage
